# Power-Consumption-Analysis-in-Households
India is the world's third largest producer and third largest consumer of electricity. The gross electricity consumption in 2018-19 was 1,181 kWh per capita. Energy use can be viewed as a function of total GDP, structure of the economy and technology. The increase in household energy consumption is more significant than that in the industrial sector. To achieve reduction in electricity consumption, it is vital to have current information about household electricity use. This Project mainly focuses on applying a machine-learning algorithm to calculate the power consumed by all appliances.  This will help you track the power consumed on regular intervals for all kinds of appliances which use heavy loads such as Air Conditioners, Oven or a washing machine etc.
